// insertion sort where assume the first element of array is already sorted
// so we just loop over the rest of the array and create a 'j' variable that will track
// the previous element to 'i'. while j is not <= 0 we continue comparing all the elements before
// the 'i' variable. Need two loops so the worst complexity is theta(n^2)
